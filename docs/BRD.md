# Business Requirements Document: Multi-Tenant SaaS Gym Scheduling and Management System

## 1. Vision & Scope
This section outlines the overarching vision, objectives, and scope for the development of a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Gym Scheduling and Management System.

### 1.1. Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a highly scalable, resilient, and secure cloud-based SaaS platform. This platform will serve as a comprehensive operational hub tailored for fitness centers, gyms, wellness studios, and similar businesses. It aims to empower these organizations to streamline their day-to-day activities, enhance client engagement, and facilitate seamless scheduling and resource management. The platform is intended to be a catalyst for growth for these businesses by improving operational efficiency, increasing client acquisition and retention, and enabling the delivery of superior service. The adoption of a SaaS model is well-established in this industry, as demonstrated by platforms like Mindbody.1 The cloud-based nature is fundamental to ensuring accessibility from any location and the scalability required for a multi-tenant application designed to serve a growing number of distinct businesses.2 A core underlying goal is the significant reduction of administrative overhead for gym owners and their staff. This allows them to redirect their focus from time-consuming manual tasks towards core service delivery, business development, and enhancing the client experience, addressing a common pain point that systems like Mindbody aim to solve through features such as automated staff management and simplified administrative duties.3

### 1.2. Inspiration and Core Value Proposition
The system will draw functional inspiration from the extensive suite of gym management tools offered by industry leader Mindbody, aiming to provide a holistic solution that encompasses scheduling, comprehensive client relationship management, effective staff management, and basic operational oversight.1 Simultaneously, the platform will emulate the renowned intuitive design and ease of use characteristic of Google Calendar for all scheduling-related functionalities. This dual approach ensures a minimal learning curve for users across all roles, from administrators to members.7

The core value proposition lies in delivering a platform that is not only powerful and feature-rich but also exceptionally user-friendly and accessible. This positions the system to potentially attract businesses that find existing comprehensive solutions, such as some Mindbody tiers, too complex or expensive 1, or conversely, find simpler scheduling tools too limited for their broader management needs. The emphasis on an "intuitive" experience is a direct response to the potential complexities often associated with feature-laden management systems, aiming to offer a balanced solution that combines depth of functionality with simplicity of operation. Mindbody, for example, offers a wide array of tools covering scheduling, payment processing, client management, and marketing 1, while Google Calendar excels in providing shareable booking pages, automated reminders, and effective conflict avoidance mechanisms.7 By integrating these strengths, the platform seeks to carve out a distinct market position.

### 1.3. Target Market & User Segments
The primary target market for this SaaS platform includes small to medium-sized fitness centers, independent gyms, specialized yoga and Pilates studios, comprehensive wellness centers, and personal training businesses. These establishments often require robust management tools but may lack the resources for highly customized or enterprise-level solutions.

Within these organizations, key user segments are:
Owners/Organization Administrators: Seeking high-level business oversight and tools to manage their facility's overall strategy and settings.
Administrators/Managers: Responsible for day-to-day operations, staff management, detailed scheduling, and member relations.
Staff (Trainers, Instructors, Front Desk): Focused on delivering services, managing their schedules, tracking client attendance, and interacting with members.
Members (Clients): The end-users seeking easy ways to book classes and appointments, manage their memberships, and interact with the facility.
The platform must cater to the diverse needs and technical proficiency levels of these segments. This aligns with the target demographic of Mindbody, which includes yoga studios, boutique fitness studios, and wellness centers, whose clientele are typically individuals aged 25-45 prioritizing health and well-being.1 While Mindbody addresses a broad wellness market, an initial focus on the specific operational needs of fitness and gym facilities may allow for a more deeply tailored and competitive offering. The multi-tenant architecture is fundamental to efficiently serving numerous independent businesses, each with its unique data, configurations, and branding, all while sharing the underlying platform infrastructure.2 This necessitates robust data isolation and customizable settings from the outset to ensure each tenant operates securely and distinctly.

### 1.4. High-Level System Goals
The platform is designed to achieve several interconnected high-level goals:
Streamline Operations: Automate and simplify core business processes. This includes, but is not limited to, class and appointment scheduling, staff rota management, member check-ins, and payment processing. The aim is to reduce manual effort and the potential for errors.
Enhance Client Engagement: Provide tools that foster improved communication, enable personalized client experiences, offer easy self-service booking and account management, and facilitate the tracking of client progress.6 This directly contributes to client satisfaction and loyalty.
Facilitate Seamless Scheduling: Offer intuitive, flexible, and visually clear calendar views. Ensure that booking, modifying, and canceling sessions are straightforward processes for all user types. Implement robust conflict detection to prevent overbooking and scheduling errors.7
Provide Basic Operational Overview: Offer simple summaries of operational activity to help businesses understand their performance (e.g., popular classes, peak times).
These goals are not independent; they form a synergistic relationship. For instance, streamlined operations, such as automated staff substitution and payroll data tracking 3, free up valuable staff time. This recovered time can then be reinvested into activities that enhance client engagement, like personalized follow-ups derived from comprehensive client profiles.6 Furthermore, a seamless scheduling experience, characterized by easy online booking and clear communication 15, is a direct and significant component of overall client engagement and satisfaction. Finally, an overview of class popularity or staff activity can inform strategic decisions to further streamline operations (e.g., optimizing class schedules based on demand) or to refine engagement strategies (e.g., recognizing and rewarding popular instructors). This creates a virtuous cycle, continually improving both efficiency and client value.

### 1.5. Key Success Factors
The success of the Gym Scheduling and Management System will be measured by several key factors:
User Adoption: High rates of adoption and consistent active use across all defined user roles (Super Admin, Organization Admin, Admin, Staff, Member). This will be driven by the platform's perceived ease of use, clear value proposition, and effective onboarding.
System Reliability & Performance: Consistent and predictable system uptime, fast application response times for all key interactions, and accurate, timely data processing are crucial. Users expect a system that is always available and performs efficiently.17
Scalability: The platform's architecture must be capable of seamlessly handling growth in the number of tenant organizations, the volume of users within each organization, and the overall quantity of transactional data, without degradation in performance or requiring disruptive overhauls.2
Security: Robust and demonstrable protection of sensitive client, staff, and business data is paramount, especially given the multi-tenant nature of the platform where data isolation is critical.2
Client Retention (for Gyms): The platform should demonstrably contribute to the ability of participating gyms and studios to retain their members by enhancing service quality, engagement, and ease of interaction.
Feature Completeness (MVP to Full Version): Successful delivery of a core set of high-value features in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), followed by an iterative development approach to add more comprehensive functionalities based on user feedback and market demands.
For any SaaS product, particularly in a competitive landscape, "User Adoption" and "System Reliability & Performance" are foundational. A feature-rich system will fail to gain traction if it is difficult to use or prone to instability.19 Furthermore, the multi-tenant architecture inherently places stringent demands on both scalability and security; a failure in either of these areas could have widespread consequences. Therefore, non-functional requirements related to usability, performance, and security are not merely technical considerations but are intrinsically linked to the core business success of the platform.

## 2. User Roles & Hierarchy
The system will implement a hierarchical multi-tenant user role structure. Each organization (e.g., gym, fitness studio, wellness center) subscribing to the platform will operate as a distinct tenant, with its data and configurations isolated from other tenants. The roles are designed to provide appropriate levels of access and control, ensuring efficient management and security.

### 2.1. Super Admin
Description: The Super Admin represents the highest level of access within the platform. This role is typically held by personnel internal to the SaaS provider and is responsible for the overall health, maintenance, and strategic management of the entire multi-tenant system.
Key Responsibilities:

Tenant Organization Management: Create new tenant organizations, manage their lifecycle (activate, deactivate), configure high-level settings specific to tenants (e.g., feature entitlements based on subscription tiers), and, if necessary, delete tenant organizations.
Organization Admin Assignment: Assign and manage the primary Organization Admin accounts for each newly created or existing tenant.
Platform Monitoring: Monitor overall system health, performance metrics (e.g., server load, database performance, API response times), and aggregate usage statistics across all tenants. (Reporting capabilities are simplified for MVP).
Platform Configuration: Manage global platform configurations, such as master lists for certain data types (if applicable), default settings, integrations with core third-party services (e.g., master payment gateway configurations), and platform-wide feature flags.
System Maintenance and Updates: Oversee the deployment of system updates, patches, and new feature releases across the platform.

The Super Admin's ability to effectively manage tenant lifecycles is crucial for the operational viability of the SaaS business model. This role necessitates a dedicated administrative interface with tools for seamless onboarding of new gyms, managing subscription parameters (though detailed billing functionality is beyond this BRD's immediate scope, the underlying infrastructure must support it), and potentially providing high-level support or troubleshooting for tenant-specific issues that cannot be resolved at the Organization Admin level. This role is conceptually similar to an "Owner" in some standalone systems 20 or the entity managing an "Enterprise Dashboard" in Mindbody for businesses with multiple locations 21, but its scope is platform-wide, overseeing all distinct tenant organizations.

### 2.2. Organization Admin
Description: The Organization Admin is the top-level administrator for a specific tenant (a single gym or studio). This role is responsible for configuring, managing, and overseeing their organization's unique instance of the platform.
Key Responsibilities:

Organization-Specific Settings Management: Configure and maintain settings unique to their organization, including facility details (name, address, contact), branding elements (logo, color themes for their member portal), business hours, specific booking policies (cancellation windows, waitlist rules), payment gateway integration details (linking their own Stripe/Square account), and local tax configurations.
Internal User Management: Create, manage (activate/deactivate, modify details), and assign roles to Admin users within their own organization.
Data and Operations Oversight: Oversee all data, scheduling, client interactions, and staff activities within their organization's instance of the platform.
Organization-Specific Overview: Access basic summaries related to their organization's activity, membership, and resource utilization.
Subscription Management: Manage their organization's subscription details with the SaaS provider, including viewing invoices and potentially upgrading/downgrading their service plan (interfacing with the SaaS provider's billing system).
Customization of Communication Templates: Customize email and SMS notification templates used for communication with their members.

The Organization Admin serves as the primary point of contact between the tenant gym and the SaaS provider. They require significant autonomy to tailor their instance of the platform to their specific operational needs and branding, but these customizations occur within the functional boundaries and feature sets defined by the Super Admin and the platform's capabilities. Absolute data isolation is paramount; an Organization Admin of "Gym A" must have no means to access, view, or even infer the existence of data belonging to "Gym B." The clear hierarchy established is Super Admin managing multiple Organizations, each Organization having an Organization Admin who, in turn, manages Admins within that specific Organization. This structure ensures that tenant-specific configurations like class types, staff lists, and pricing models are managed at the appropriate level, allowing each gym to leverage the platform effectively for its unique business.

### 2.3. Admin
Description: An Admin is an operational manager within a specific gym or studio (tenant). This role is responsible for executing and overseeing many of the day-to-day management tasks essential for the smooth running of the facility.
Key Responsibilities:

Staff Management: Create and manage staff profiles, including assigning roles (e.g., "Trainer," "Front Desk" – which map to system roles with predefined permissions), defining their service capabilities, setting their work schedules, and potentially inputting data relevant for payroll.
Member Management: Create and manage member profiles, including inputting personal details, assigning membership types, tracking membership status, managing payment information (tokenized), and recording attendance.
Scheduling Oversight: Oversee class and appointment scheduling, which includes creating new class series or individual appointment slots, editing existing sessions (e.g., changing instructor, time, or location), and canceling sessions when necessary (with appropriate notifications to affected members and staff).
Resource Allocation: Manage the allocation of physical resources such as rooms, specific equipment, or designated training areas to ensure optimal utilization and prevent conflicts.
Billing and Point-of-Sale (POS): Handle billing inquiries, process payments for memberships and services, and manage POS transactions for retail items (if this functionality is included).
Operational Overview: Review operational summaries, such as daily attendance logs and class fill rates.
Client Communication Management: Manage and utilize templates for routine client communications, and potentially handle direct client inquiries.

Admins are power users of the system who require efficient and intuitive workflows for a wide range of common operational tasks. Their permissions need to be sufficiently granular to allow them to manage their areas of responsibility effectively, without granting them access to more sensitive Organization Admin-level settings, such as modifying the gym's subscription plan with the SaaS provider or altering fundamental organizational configurations. This role aligns with the "Manager" role described in systems like Gym Insight 20 or experienced staff members in Mindbody who have "Settings Permissions" enabling them to manage aspects like staff availability, service categories, and pricing options.22 The efficiency of the Admin user interface and the robustness of the features available to them will directly impact the overall operational efficiency of the gym.

### 2.4. Staff (e.g., Trainer, Instructor, Front Desk)
Description: Staff users are employees of the gym or studio who are primarily involved in delivering services to members or managing front-desk operations. This category can include personal trainers, group fitness instructors, yoga teachers, and front-desk personnel.
Key Responsibilities:

Schedule Management: Create, view, and manage their own class or appointment schedules and availability. This includes blocking out times they are unavailable and potentially requesting shift changes or substitutions.
Attendance Tracking: Mark member attendance for the classes they instruct or appointments they conduct.
Client Interaction: View relevant information from member profiles (e.g., booking history, specific needs or preferences noted by admins) to personalize service delivery.
Booking Management (Potentially): Depending on permissions set by the Admin or Organization Admin, staff might be able to manage their own bookings, such as adding a client to their personal training slot.
Communication: Communicate with members regarding their scheduled sessions (e.g., sending reminders or follow-up notes, if enabled).
Payroll-Related Actions: Utilize features such as clocking in and out for accurate tracking of work hours, if this functionality is integrated.

Staff users require a simple, accessible, and often mobile-friendly interface to perform their core tasks efficiently. Empowering staff with capabilities like managing their own availability can improve job satisfaction and contribute to greater operational flexibility for the gym. Mindbody, for instance, provides tools for staff to manage schedules and track performance, and even allows staff to share their schedules via social media through its business app.3 Permissions for Staff users must be carefully configured to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive member data (beyond what is necessary for service delivery), financial information, or administrative settings. This role corresponds to the "Personal Trainer" or "Front Desk" roles in Gym Insight 20 or general staff members in Mindbody who manage their availability and appointments.22 A personalized dashboard for each staff member, displaying their upcoming classes, client lists, and potentially key performance indicators, would be highly beneficial.

### 2.5. Member (Client)
Description: A Member is the end-user of the gym or studio's services, also referred to as a client. Their interaction with the platform is primarily focused on accessing services and managing their personal account.
Key Responsibilities:

Personalized Information Access: View their personal schedules (upcoming and past bookings), current membership status and entitlements (e.g., remaining classes in a pack).
Service Booking: Search for and book new appointments (e.g., personal training) or classes, filtered by criteria such as service type, instructor, date, and time, based on real-time availability and their specific membership permissions.
Booking Management: Modify or cancel their existing bookings, subject to the gym's established policies (e.g., cancellation deadlines) and system-enforced permissions.
Profile Management: Update their personal profile information, such as contact details (email, phone number), address, and potentially payment methods (securely managed and tokenized).
Payments: Make online payments for services, membership renewals, or outstanding balances.

The member experience is a critical determinant of client satisfaction and, consequently, retention for the gyms using the platform. The member-facing interface (whether web-based or a dedicated mobile application) must be highly intuitive, easy to navigate, and provide comprehensive self-service capabilities. Clear and timely communication regarding booking confirmations, reminders, cancellations, waitlist movements, and payment receipts is essential. This user interacts with the system in a manner similar to how clients use the Mindbody platform to search for services, book appointments, and manage their accounts 5, or how individuals use Google Calendar's booking pages to schedule time.7 Systems like Gymdesk also emphasize providing members with an online account and mobile app to manage their bookings effectively.15 The success of the gyms utilizing this SaaS platform will be significantly influenced by the quality and usability of this member-facing interface.

## 3. Key Functional Requirements
This section details the core functionalities the Gym Scheduling and Management System must provide to meet the needs of its users, focusing on the MVP scope of organization management, user management, and scheduling.

### 3.1. Scheduling System
The scheduling system is the cornerstone of the platform, designed to offer robust, flexible, and intuitive capabilities for managing various types of services offered by fitness and wellness businesses.

#### 3.1.1. Appointment & Class Booking
Description: The system must enable authorized users (primarily Staff, Admins, and Members) to seamlessly create, view, edit, and cancel bookings for both appointments (typically one-on-one sessions like personal training, consultations) and classes (group sessions like yoga, spin, HIIT).
User Flows:

Member Perspective:

Search & Discovery: Members can search for available classes or appointment slots. Filters should allow them to narrow down options by service type (e.g., "Yoga," "Personal Training"), specific instructor/staff member, date, and time.
Selection & Booking: Upon finding a suitable slot, members can select it and proceed to confirm their booking. The system should verify their eligibility (e.g., active membership, sufficient class credits).
Confirmation: After successful booking, the member receives immediate confirmation via email and/or in-app notification. The booking is automatically added to their personal calendar within the system.
Modification/Cancellation: Members can view their upcoming bookings and have the option to modify (reschedule) or cancel them, subject to the gym's predefined policies (e.g., 24-hour cancellation notice) and system permissions. The process for modification and cancellation should be clear, as outlined in help resources for systems like Acuity Scheduling 24 and Calendly.25

Staff/Admin Perspective:

Session Creation: Staff (for their own services) or Admins (for any service) can create new class instances or open up appointment availability. This includes defining parameters such as date, time, duration, maximum capacity (for classes), assigned instructor/staff, and specific resources required (e.g., room, equipment).
Pricing & Entitlement: Admins can set pricing for drop-ins or link sessions to specific membership entitlements.
Roster Management: View the roster of members booked into a class or appointment. Admins/Staff can manually add or remove members from a session if necessary (e.g., front-desk booking).
Waitlist Management: For full classes, Admins/Staff can manage the waitlist (see section 3.1.5).
Modification/Cancellation: Admins/Staff can modify details of existing sessions (e.g., change instructor due to illness, alter time) or cancel sessions. In such cases, the system must automatically notify all registered attendees. Staff permissions for these actions are detailed in systems like Mindbody.22 The process for staff-initiated rescheduling or cancellation is also covered by platforms like Acuity Scheduling.26

Context: The ability to easily book and manage schedules is a core expectation. Mindbody provides comprehensive booking and scheduling for a variety of wellness services.1 Google Calendar's model of direct booking via personal booking pages offers a benchmark for simplicity and user experience.7 Other platforms like Gymdesk and Gymflow also emphasize streamlined online booking capabilities.15 The distinction between "appointments" (often one-to-one or small group, highly dependent on specific staff availability) and "classes" (typically group sessions with fixed schedules and capacities) is fundamental. Their management workflows, booking rules, and resource requirements often differ, and the system must cater to these variations effectively.

#### 3.1.2. Recurring Event Management (RRULE)
Description: The system must support the creation and management of recurring classes and appointments. This is essential for services that occur regularly, such as a "Yoga Flow class every Monday at 6 PM" or "Personal Training sessions every Wednesday and Friday at 9 AM." Implementation must adhere to the iCalendar RRULE (Recurrence Rule) standard as specified in the user query.
Functionality:

Rule Definition: Users (typically Admins or Staff) must be able to define complex recurrence patterns, including:

Frequency: Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly.
Interval: e.g., every 2 weeks, every 3 days.
Specific Days: For weekly recurrences, specify days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday). For monthly/yearly, specify day of the month (e.g., the 15th) or day of the week within the month (e.g., the second Tuesday).
End Conditions: Define when the recurrence ends, either after a specific number of occurrences or on a particular date.

Instance Generation: The system must accurately generate all individual instances of a recurring event based on the defined RRULE.
Human-Readable Display: While RRULEs are stored programmatically (often as strings), the system should display the recurrence pattern in a human-readable format (e.g., "Repeats every week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 10 occurrences") to the user who is setting it up.27
Exception Handling: Allow for modifications or cancellations of individual instances within a recurring series without affecting the entire series (e.g., a specific Monday yoga class is cancelled due to a public holiday).
Series Updates: Define how updates to the parent recurring event (e.g., changing the time of the entire series) propagate to future, unmodified child instances. Users should have options like "update this event only," "update this and all future events," or "update all events in the series."

Context: The rrule library for Node.js provides a practical example of implementing RRULE functionality, including methods for creating rules from parameters, storing them as strings (e.g., rule.toString()), parsing them from strings (e.g., RRule.fromString()), and generating human-readable text (e.g., rule.toText()).27 Tools like RRULE generators can also assist developers or advanced users in constructing valid RRULE strings.28 The complexity in RRULE implementation often lies in managing the series of events as a whole versus individual occurrences. For instance, if an instructor for a recurring class changes permanently from a certain date, the update should apply to all subsequent instances from that date onwards, while preserving the history of previous instances. This requires careful logic for handling series modifications and exceptions.

#### 3.1.3. Real-Time Calendar Views
Description: The system must provide dynamic, interactive, and real-time calendar views tailored to the needs of different user roles. These views are essential for visualizing schedules, availability, and bookings.
Functionality:

View Types: Standard calendar views including Daily, Weekly, and Monthly formats must be available. A "List" or "Agenda" view can also be beneficial for a chronological listing of events.
Role-Specific Views:

Members: Can view their personal calendar displaying only their booked sessions and appointments.
Staff: Can view their own assigned classes and appointments. Depending on permissions, they might also see schedules of other staff members they collaborate with or resources they manage.
Admins/Organization Admins: Have a comprehensive view of all scheduled activities within their organization, including all staff schedules, resource utilization (rooms, equipment), and class rosters.

Real-Time Updates: Calendars must update in real-time or near real-time across all relevant user interfaces as bookings are made, modified, or cancelled. This minimizes the risk of users acting on outdated information.
Visual Cues: Events on the calendar should use visual cues (e.g., color-coding, icons) to indicate status (e.g., confirmed, tentative, cancelled, waitlisted, full capacity) or type of service.
Navigation & Filtering: Easy navigation between dates/weeks/months. Filtering options (e.g., by staff member, resource, service type) are particularly important for Admin views to manage complexity.

Context: Google Calendar is a prime example of effective calendar visualization, known for its ability to layer multiple calendars and provide clear, responsive views.8 Mindbody also inherently provides various scheduling views to support its extensive booking features.1 The "real-time" aspect is critical. If a member books the last spot in a class, that class should immediately appear as full on an Admin's calendar and be unavailable for further booking by other members. The performance of these calendar views, especially for Admins overseeing a busy facility with numerous daily events and staff, is a key non-functional requirement. Efficient data fetching (e.g., loading only the visible date range initially) and optimized rendering strategies will be necessary to ensure a smooth user experience.

#### 3.1.4. Conflict Detection & Resolution
Description: The system must implement robust mechanisms to automatically detect and either prevent or clearly flag scheduling conflicts. This is crucial for maintaining an organized and error-free schedule.
Types of Conflicts to Detect:

Staff Double-Booking: A staff member being scheduled for two or more overlapping classes or appointments.
Resource Double-Booking: A specific room or piece of equipment being booked for two or more overlapping events.
Member Double-Booking: A member attempting to book themselves into two or more overlapping sessions.
Booking Outside Staff Availability: Attempting to schedule a staff member for a time they have marked as unavailable or outside their defined working hours.
Resource Unavailability: Attempting to book a resource that is unavailable (e.g., due to maintenance).

Functionality:

Real-Time Alerts: During the scheduling process (whether by an Admin, Staff, or Member), if an action would create a conflict, the system should provide an immediate alert or prevent the action.
Conflict Indication: Clearly indicate existing conflicts on calendar views for Admins and relevant Staff.
Resolution Assistance (for Admins/Staff): When a conflict is detected or arises (e.g., due to a last-minute change), the system may offer suggestions for resolution, such as identifying alternative available staff members with the required skills, or suggesting other available time slots or resources.

Context: Effective conflict detection is a hallmark of good scheduling software. Google Calendar offers "multiple calendar checks to avoid conflicts".7 More specialized systems like Shyft (for employee scheduling) provide "real-time conflict detection" and even "automated resolution suggestions".12 The fundamental algorithm for checking if two time intervals conflict involves comparing their start and end times: two events (event1, event2) do not conflict if event1.endTime <= event2.startTime OR event1.startTime >= event2.endTime. If this condition is false, a conflict exists.29 For checking a new appointment against many existing appointments, more advanced data structures like Interval Trees can optimize performance.30 The system's conflict detection logic needs to be comprehensive, considering not just direct time overlaps but potentially also buffer times (e.g., setup/cleanup time for a room between classes) or travel time for staff if they operate across multiple locations (though multi-location is not explicitly in scope for MVP, the architecture should not preclude it). The user experience for presenting conflict information and guiding users towards resolution is as important as the detection itself; it should be informative and helpful rather than merely prohibitive.

#### 3.1.5. Waitlist Management
Description: The system must allow members to join a waitlist for classes or appointments that are currently fully booked. This feature helps maximize attendance and revenue while improving member satisfaction.
Functionality:

Joining a Waitlist: When a member attempts to book a full class/session, if waitlisting is enabled for that session, they should be offered the option to join the waitlist.
Automated Notifications: If a spot becomes available (e.g., due to a cancellation), the system should automatically notify one or more members from the waitlist. The notification method (email, SMS, in-app push) should be configurable.
Claiming a Spot: The process for claiming an open spot needs clear rules:

Order: Typically, notifications go to members in the order they joined the waitlist (first-in, first-out).
Response Window: The notified member might have a limited time window (e.g., 1 hour, configurable by the gym) to confirm and book the spot.
Rollover: If the first notified member declines or does not respond within the window, the spot can be offered to the next person on the waitlist.

Admin/Staff Oversight: Admins and relevant Staff should be able to view the current waitlist for any session, manually add or remove members from the waitlist, and potentially manually move a waitlisted member into an open spot.
Waitlist Capacity: Optionally, gyms might be able to set a maximum size for waitlists.

Context: Waitlist functionality is a common and valued feature in gym management software. Gymdesk, for example, allows members to join a waitlist when a session is fully booked.15 Hapana's platform can help automate the handling of waitlists.14 Effective waitlist management turns potential lost opportunities (due to cancellations) into filled spots, benefiting both the gym (maximized revenue) and members (increased chance to attend popular classes). The logic for notification and spot-claiming must be transparent and fair to avoid member frustration. For example, the system needs to clearly communicate how long a member has to respond to a waitlist notification before the offer expires.

### 3.2. Client Management
This module will provide a comprehensive suite of tools for managing all aspects of the client lifecycle relevant to scheduling and basic account management for the MVP.

#### 3.2.1. Comprehensive Member Profiles
Description: Each member will have a centralized and detailed profile, serving as the single source of truth for all information related to them.
Data Points: The member profile should capture a wide range of information for MVP, including but not limited to:

*   Basic Information: Full name, preferred name, unique Member ID (system-generated).
*   Contact Details: Email address (primary for login and communication), phone number(s), physical address.
*   Personal Details: Profile photo (optional upload), birthdate, gender (optional).
*   Emergency Contact: Name and phone number of an emergency contact.
*   Membership Information: Basic membership status (e.g., active, inactive) relevant for booking access.
*   Booking & Attendance Log: A log of upcoming bookings and recent attendance records (checked-in, no-show, late cancel).
*   Communication Notes: A log of key system-generated scheduling-related communications sent to the member (e.g., booking confirmations).
*   Notes & Alerts: A section for Admins/Staff to add private notes (e.g., client preferences, goals, medical considerations relevant to their training, "first visit" flag 6). Alerts could flag important information to staff when accessing the profile.
*   Account Credentials: Username (email) and secure password management.

Context: Rich member profiles are fundamental to effective client relationship management. Mindbody's client profiles, for example, consolidate preferences, service history, and allow for personalized notes and follow-ups.6 The ability to capture such detailed information enables gyms to personalize services, tailor communications, and understand their client base better. Given the sensitivity of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and potentially health-related notes, the security and privacy of this data are paramount.

#### 3.2.2. Attendance Tracking
Description: The system must accurately record and display member attendance for all booked classes and appointments.
Functionality:

Check-in Mechanisms:

Staff-Initiated: Staff members (instructors, front desk) can mark members as attended, no-show, or late cancel directly from class rosters or appointment details.
Automated (Future Consideration): While not necessarily MVP, the system should be architected to potentially support member self-check-in via a mobile app (e.g., QR code scan, geo-fenced check-in) or a dedicated kiosk app at the facility, similar to Mindbody's Class Check-in app.6

Attendance Records: Detailed logs of attendance status for every booking, linked to the member's profile.
Attendance Summaries: Provide basic summaries of attendance (e.g., per class, per member).

Context: Attendance data is important for operational oversight. Mindbody tracks visit history.6 Other gym management platforms like Gymdesk track member attendance.31 This information helps in managing class rosters and understanding basic attendance patterns.

### 3.3. Staff Management
This module will provide tools for organizing, scheduling, and managing gym staff for the MVP.

#### 3.3.1. Staff Profiles & Role Assignment
Description: The system will allow Admins or Organization Admins to create and maintain detailed profiles for all staff members.
Data Points: Each staff profile should include:

*   Basic Information: Full name, contact information (email, phone).
*   Profile Photo: Optional.
*   System Role: Assignment to a system role (e.g., "Staff," "Admin" – linking to the roles defined in Section 2) which dictates their access permissions.
*   Job Title/Responsibilities: e.g., "Senior Trainer," "Yoga Instructor," "Front Desk Manager."
*   Qualifications/Certifications: A section to list relevant qualifications, certifications, and expiry dates.
*   Services Provided: Ability to link staff members to specific classes or appointment types they are qualified to deliver. This is crucial for scheduling logic.
*   Availability Templates: Default working hours or availability patterns.

Context: Staff profiles are central to many system functions, including scheduling (determining who can teach which class) and access control. Mindbody allows businesses to manage staff, including assigning roles and controlling permissions.3 A comprehensive staff profile ensures that all relevant information is readily available for administrative and operational purposes. For example, when scheduling a "Advanced Pilates" class, the system should only allow selection of instructors whose profiles indicate they are qualified for that service.

#### 3.3.2. Staff Scheduling & Availability Tracking
Description: The system must provide tools for creating staff work schedules and enabling staff members to manage and communicate their availability for appointments and classes.
Functionality:

Shift Scheduling (Admin): Admins or Organization Admins can create and publish staff shifts or assign staff to specific time blocks for front desk coverage or other duties.
Availability Management (Staff): Staff members can input their general availability (e.g., "available Mondays 9 AM - 5 PM, Wednesdays 12 PM - 8 PM") and specific unavailability (e.g., requesting time off for a vacation). This availability will then be used by the system when scheduling them for classes or appointments.
Time-Off Requests: A formal workflow for staff to request time off, which can then be approved or denied by an Admin. Approved time off automatically blocks their availability.
Automated Staff Substitution: If a scheduled staff member becomes unavailable (e.g., calls in sick), the system should assist in finding a replacement. This could involve:

Suggesting other qualified and available staff members.
Allowing available staff to view and claim open shifts/classes.
Automated notifications to potential substitutes.

Context: Efficient staff scheduling is vital for ensuring adequate coverage for classes and services, and for smooth gym operations. Mindbody allows businesses to manage staff schedules and even automate staff substitutions to avoid class cancellations and maintain revenue flow.3 Staff are also able to manage their availability for appointments.22 Giving staff some control over their availability can improve morale and reduce the administrative burden on managers. The substitution feature, in particular, is a significant value-add as it directly addresses a common operational challenge in service businesses. This implies a calendar interface for staff to set their working hours and for admins to assign them to classes or shifts. The substitution feature would require a workflow where a staff member indicates unavailability for a scheduled class, and the system then helps identify and assign a qualified replacement based on skills and availability.

### 3.5. Organization Management (for Admins)
This section details the settings and tools that Organization Admins will use to configure and customize their specific gym instance within the multi-tenant platform, focusing on MVP requirements.

#### 3.5.1. Facility & Resource Management
Description: Organization Admins must be able to define and manage their physical locations (if they have multiple sites under one organization, though the primary model is one organization = one tenant/gym), rooms within those locations, and key equipment.
Functionality:

Location Setup: Define main facility details (name, address, contact information, business hours).
Room/Space Management: Create and name individual rooms or designated spaces within the facility (e.g., "Main Studio," "Spin Room," "Treatment Room 1").
Resource Capacity: Set the capacity for each room or space (e.g., "Main Studio - 20 mats," "Spin Room - 15 bikes").
Equipment Listing: List available equipment that might be bookable or relevant for class descriptions (e.g., "Pilates Reformers," "TRX Stations").
Resource Linking: Resources (rooms, specific equipment) can be linked to specific classes or appointment types during their setup. This is essential for preventing conflicts (e.g., ensuring a class requiring 10 spin bikes is scheduled in a room that has them, and that the room isn't double-booked).

Context: Effective scheduling and conflict detection are heavily reliant on accurate facility and resource definitions. The Admin role is tasked with overseeing resource allocation as per the user query. If a specific room is booked for a yoga class, the system must know this to prevent another class or appointment from being scheduled in the same room simultaneously. Similarly, understanding resource capacities (like the number of spin bikes) prevents overbooking classes that depend on such equipment.

#### 3.5.2. Service & Class Type Configuration
Description: Organization Admins need the ability to define and configure the various types of services (appointments) and classes offered by their gym.
Functionality:

Service/Class Creation: Create distinct service or class types with unique names (e.g., "60-minute Personal Training Session," "Advanced Vinyasa Yoga," "Beginner Spin Class").
Default Duration: Set a default duration for each service/class type.
Resource Association: Assign default resources (e.g., "Yoga Studio" for yoga classes, "Reformer Bed" for Pilates appointments) to service/class types.
Staff Qualification Linking: Specify which staff members are qualified to provide or instruct each service/class type.
Description & Category: Add descriptions, categories (e.g., "Cardio," "Mind & Body," "Strength"), and potentially difficulty levels.

Context: This configuration forms the backbone of the scheduling system. What members can see and book, and how schedules are constructed by Admins and Staff, is driven by these definitions. Mindbody's system allows for the setup of appointment types and class types, with staff permissions to add or edit these.22 The ability for Staff to "Create and manage class schedules" (as per the user query) implies that these foundational class types must be defined first by an administrator. Flexibility in defining these services is key to accommodating the diverse offerings of different fitness businesses.

## 4. Access Control & Permissions
This section outlines the security model, focusing on role-based access to system functionalities. Access control will be managed by assigning users to predefined roles, each with a specific set of responsibilities and capabilities within the system.

### 4.1. Authentication
Description: The system will provide secure mechanisms for verifying user identity.
Mechanisms:
*   Users will authenticate using a unique email address and a secure password.
*   The system will enforce basic password security practices.

### 4.2. Authorization & User Roles
Description: Authorization will be managed through a role-based access control (RBAC) model. Each user will be assigned a role that dictates their access to various features and data within their organization's scope. The focus for MVP is on high-level role definitions and their primary responsibilities.

The following roles are defined for the MVP:

*   **Super Admin:**
    *   Responsibilities: Overall platform administration, managing system-wide settings, overseeing all organizations. (Primarily for the SaaS provider).
*   **Organization Admin:**
    *   Responsibilities: Manages all aspects of their specific organization, including configuring organization settings, managing staff and member accounts within their organization, and defining organization-specific operational rules.
*   **Admin:**
    *   Responsibilities: Assists the Organization Admin with daily operational tasks, such as managing schedules, staff assignments, member communications, and reviewing operational summaries for their organization.
*   **Staff (e.g., Instructors, Trainers, Front Desk):**
    *   Responsibilities: Manages their own schedules, conducts classes/appointments, views relevant client information for their sessions, and records attendance. Access is generally limited to their assigned duties and client interactions.
*   **Member (Client/Customer):**
    *   Responsibilities: Manages their own profile, books and cancels classes/appointments, views their schedule. Access is limited to their personal data and booking functionalities.

## 5. Key Functional Requirements
This section details the core functionalities the Gym Scheduling and Management System must provide to meet the needs of its users, focusing on the MVP scope of organization management, user management, and scheduling.

### 5.1. Scheduling System
The scheduling system is the cornerstone of the platform, designed to offer robust, flexible, and intuitive capabilities for managing various types of services offered by fitness and wellness businesses.

#### 5.1.1. Appointment & Class Booking
Description: The system must enable authorized users (primarily Staff, Admins, and Members) to seamlessly create, view, edit, and cancel bookings for both appointments (typically one-on-one sessions like personal training, consultations) and classes (group sessions like yoga, spin, HIIT).
User Flows:

Member Perspective:

Search & Discovery: Members can search for available classes or appointment slots. Filters should allow them to narrow down options by service type (e.g., "Yoga," "Personal Training"), specific instructor/staff member, date, and time.
Selection & Booking: Upon finding a suitable slot, members can select it and proceed to confirm their booking. The system should verify their eligibility (e.g., active membership, sufficient class credits).
Confirmation: After successful booking, the member receives immediate confirmation via email and/or in-app notification. The booking is automatically added to their personal calendar within the system.
Modification/Cancellation: Members can view their upcoming bookings and have the option to modify (reschedule) or cancel them, subject to the gym's predefined policies (e.g., 24-hour cancellation notice) and system permissions. The process for modification and cancellation should be clear, as outlined in help resources for systems like Acuity Scheduling 24 and Calendly.25

Staff/Admin Perspective:

Session Creation: Staff (for their own services) or Admins (for any service) can create new class instances or open up appointment availability. This includes defining parameters such as date, time, duration, maximum capacity (for classes), assigned instructor/staff, and specific resources required (e.g., room, equipment).
Pricing & Entitlement: Admins can set pricing for drop-ins or link sessions to specific membership entitlements.
Roster Management: View the roster of members booked into a class or appointment. Admins/Staff can manually add or remove members from a session if necessary (e.g., front-desk booking).
Waitlist Management: For full classes, Admins/Staff can manage the waitlist (see section 3.1.5).
Modification/Cancellation: Admins/Staff can modify details of existing sessions (e.g., change instructor due to illness, alter time) or cancel sessions. In such cases, the system must automatically notify all registered attendees. Staff permissions for these actions are detailed in systems like Mindbody.22 The process for staff-initiated rescheduling or cancellation is also covered by platforms like Acuity Scheduling.26

Context: The ability to easily book and manage schedules is a core expectation. Mindbody provides comprehensive booking and scheduling for a variety of wellness services.1 Google Calendar's model of direct booking via personal booking pages offers a benchmark for simplicity and user experience.7 Other platforms like Gymdesk and Gymflow also emphasize streamlined online booking capabilities.15 The distinction between "appointments" (often one-to-one or small group, highly dependent on specific staff availability) and "classes" (typically group sessions with fixed schedules and capacities) is fundamental. Their management workflows, booking rules, and resource requirements often differ, and the system must cater to these variations effectively.

#### 5.1.2. Recurring Event Management (RRULE)
Description: The system must support the creation and management of recurring classes and appointments. This is essential for services that occur regularly, such as a "Yoga Flow class every Monday at 6 PM" or "Personal Training sessions every Wednesday and Friday at 9 AM." Implementation must adhere to the iCalendar RRULE (Recurrence Rule) standard as specified in the user query.
Functionality:

Rule Definition: Users (typically Admins or Staff) must be able to define complex recurrence patterns, including:

Frequency: Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly.
Interval: e.g., every 2 weeks, every 3 days.
Specific Days: For weekly recurrences, specify days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday). For monthly/yearly, specify day of the month (e.g., the 15th) or day of the week within the month (e.g., the second Tuesday).
End Conditions: Define when the recurrence ends, either after a specific number of occurrences or on a particular date.

Instance Generation: The system must accurately generate all individual instances of a recurring event based on the defined RRULE.
Human-Readable Display: While RRULEs are stored programmatically (often as strings), the system should display the recurrence pattern in a human-readable format (e.g., "Repeats every week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 10 occurrences") to the user who is setting it up.27
Exception Handling: Allow for modifications or cancellations of individual instances within a recurring series without affecting the entire series (e.g., a specific Monday yoga class is cancelled due to a public holiday).
Series Updates: Define how updates to the parent recurring event (e.g., changing the time of the entire series) propagate to future, unmodified child instances. Users should have options like "update this event only," "update this and all future events," or "update all events in the series."

Context: The rrule library for Node.js provides a practical example of implementing RRULE functionality, including methods for creating rules from parameters, storing them as strings (e.g., rule.toString()), parsing them from strings (e.g., RRule.fromString()), and generating human-readable text (e.g., rule.toText()).27 Tools like RRULE generators can also assist developers or advanced users in constructing valid RRULE strings.28 The complexity in RRULE implementation often lies in managing the series of events as a whole versus individual occurrences. For instance, if an instructor for a recurring class changes permanently from a certain date, the update should apply to all subsequent instances from that date onwards, while preserving the history of previous instances. This requires careful logic for handling series modifications and exceptions.

#### 5.1.3. Real-Time Calendar Views
Description: The system must provide dynamic, interactive, and real-time calendar views tailored to the needs of different user roles. These views are essential for visualizing schedules, availability, and bookings.
Functionality:

View Types: Standard calendar views including Daily, Weekly, and Monthly formats must be available. A "List" or "Agenda" view can also be beneficial for a chronological listing of events.
Role-Specific Views:

Members: Can view their personal calendar displaying only their booked sessions and appointments.
Staff: Can view their own assigned classes and appointments. Depending on permissions, they might also see schedules of other staff members they collaborate with or resources they manage.
Admins/Organization Admins: Have a comprehensive view of all scheduled activities within their organization, including all staff schedules, resource utilization (rooms, equipment), and class rosters.

Real-Time Updates: Calendars must update in real-time or near real-time across all relevant user interfaces as bookings are made, modified, or cancelled. This minimizes the risk of users acting on outdated information.
Visual Cues: Events on the calendar should use visual cues (e.g., color-coding, icons) to indicate status (e.g., confirmed, tentative, cancelled, waitlisted, full capacity) or type of service.
Navigation & Filtering: Easy navigation between dates/weeks/months. Filtering options (e.g., by staff member, resource, service type) are particularly important for Admin views to manage complexity.

Context: Google Calendar is a prime example of effective calendar visualization, known for its ability to layer multiple calendars and provide clear, responsive views.8 Mindbody also inherently provides various scheduling views to support its extensive booking features.1 The "real-time" aspect is critical. If a member books the last spot in a class, that class should immediately appear as full on an Admin's calendar and be unavailable for further booking by other members. The performance of these calendar views, especially for Admins overseeing a busy facility with numerous daily events and staff, is a key non-functional requirement. Efficient data fetching (e.g., loading only the visible date range initially) and optimized rendering strategies will be necessary to ensure a smooth user experience.

#### 5.1.4. Conflict Detection & Resolution
Description: The system must implement robust mechanisms to automatically detect and either prevent or clearly flag scheduling conflicts. This is crucial for maintaining an organized and error-free schedule.
Types of Conflicts to Detect:

Staff Double-Booking: A staff member being scheduled for two or more overlapping classes or appointments.
Resource Double-Booking: A specific room or piece of equipment being booked for two or more overlapping events.
Member Double-Booking: A member attempting to book themselves into two or more overlapping sessions.
Booking Outside Staff Availability: Attempting to schedule a staff member for a time they have marked as unavailable or outside their defined working hours.
Resource Unavailability: Attempting to book a resource that is unavailable (e.g., due to maintenance).

Functionality:

Real-Time Alerts: During the scheduling process (whether by an Admin, Staff, or Member), if an action would create a conflict, the system should provide an immediate alert or prevent the action.
Conflict Indication: Clearly indicate existing conflicts on calendar views for Admins and relevant Staff.
Resolution Assistance (for Admins/Staff): When a conflict is detected or arises (e.g., due to a last-minute change), the system may offer suggestions for resolution, such as identifying alternative available staff members with the required skills, or suggesting other available time slots or resources.

Context: Effective conflict detection is a hallmark of good scheduling software. Google Calendar offers "multiple calendar checks to avoid conflicts".7 More specialized systems like Shyft (for employee scheduling) provide "real-time conflict detection" and even "automated resolution suggestions".12 The fundamental algorithm for checking if two time intervals conflict involves comparing their start and end times: two events (event1, event2) do not conflict if event1.endTime <= event2.startTime OR event1.startTime >= event2.endTime. If this condition is false, a conflict exists.29 For checking a new appointment against many existing appointments, more advanced data structures like Interval Trees can optimize performance.30 The system's conflict detection logic needs to be comprehensive, considering not just direct time overlaps but potentially also buffer times (e.g., setup/cleanup time for a room between classes) or travel time for staff if they operate across multiple locations (though multi-location is not explicitly in scope for MVP, the architecture should not preclude it). The user experience for presenting conflict information and guiding users towards resolution is as important as the detection itself; it should be informative and helpful rather than merely prohibitive.

#### 5.1.5. Waitlist Management
Description: The system must allow members to join a waitlist for classes or appointments that are currently fully booked. This feature helps maximize attendance and revenue while improving member satisfaction.
Functionality:

Joining a Waitlist: When a member attempts to book a full class/session, if waitlisting is enabled for that session, they should be offered the option to join the waitlist.
Automated Notifications: If a spot becomes available (e.g., due to a cancellation), the system should automatically notify one or more members from the waitlist. The notification method (email, SMS, in-app push) should be configurable.
Claiming a Spot: The process for claiming an open spot needs clear rules:

Order: Typically, notifications go to members in the order they joined the waitlist (first-in, first-out).
Response Window: The notified member might have a limited time window (e.g., 1 hour, configurable by the gym) to confirm and book the spot.
Rollover: If the first notified member declines or does not respond within the window, the spot can be offered to the next person on the waitlist.

Admin/Staff Oversight: Admins and relevant Staff should be able to view the current waitlist for any session, manually add or remove members from the waitlist, and potentially manually move a waitlisted member into an open spot.
Waitlist Capacity: Optionally, gyms might be able to set a maximum size for waitlists.

Context: Waitlist functionality is a common and valued feature in gym management software. Gymdesk, for example, allows members to join a waitlist when a session is fully booked.15 Hapana's platform can help automate the handling of waitlists.14 Effective waitlist management turns potential lost opportunities (due to cancellations) into filled spots, benefiting both the gym (maximized revenue) and members (increased chance to attend popular classes). The logic for notification and spot-claiming must be transparent and fair to avoid member frustration. For example, the system needs to clearly communicate how long a member has to respond to a waitlist notification before the offer expires.

### 3.2. Client Management
This module will provide a comprehensive suite of tools for managing all aspects of the client lifecycle relevant to scheduling and basic account management for the MVP.

#### 3.2.1. Comprehensive Member Profiles
Description: Each member will have a centralized and detailed profile, serving as the single source of truth for all information related to them.
Data Points: The member profile should capture a wide range of information for MVP, including but not limited to:

*   Basic Information: Full name, preferred name, unique Member ID (system-generated).
*   Contact Details: Email address (primary for login and communication), phone number(s), physical address.
*   Personal Details: Profile photo (optional upload), birthdate, gender (optional).
*   Emergency Contact: Name and phone number of an emergency contact.
*   Membership Information: Basic membership status (e.g., active, inactive) relevant for booking access.
*   Booking & Attendance Log: A log of upcoming bookings and recent attendance records (checked-in, no-show, late cancel).
*   Communication Notes: A log of key system-generated scheduling-related communications sent to the member (e.g., booking confirmations).
*   Notes & Alerts: A section for Admins/Staff to add private notes (e.g., client preferences, goals, medical considerations relevant to their training, "first visit" flag 6). Alerts could flag important information to staff when accessing the profile.
*   Account Credentials: Username (email) and secure password management.

Context: Rich member profiles are fundamental to effective client relationship management. Mindbody's client profiles, for example, consolidate preferences, service history, and allow for personalized notes and follow-ups.6 The ability to capture such detailed information enables gyms to personalize services, tailor communications, and understand their client base better. Given the sensitivity of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and potentially health-related notes, the security and privacy of this data are paramount.

#### 3.2.2. Attendance Tracking
Description: The system must accurately record and display member attendance for all booked classes and appointments.
Functionality:

Check-in Mechanisms:

Staff-Initiated: Staff members (instructors, front desk) can mark members as attended, no-show, or late cancel directly from class rosters or appointment details.
Automated (Future Consideration): While not necessarily MVP, the system should be architected to potentially support member self-check-in via a mobile app (e.g., QR code scan, geo-fenced check-in) or a dedicated kiosk app at the facility, similar to Mindbody's Class Check-in app.6

Attendance Records: Detailed logs of attendance status for every booking, linked to the member's profile.
Attendance Summaries: Provide basic summaries of attendance (e.g., per class, per member).

Context: Attendance data is important for operational oversight. Mindbody tracks visit history.6 Other gym management platforms like Gymdesk track member attendance.31 This information helps in managing class rosters and understanding basic attendance patterns.

### 3.3. Staff Management
This module will provide tools for organizing, scheduling, and managing gym staff for the MVP.

#### 3.3.1. Staff Profiles & Role Assignment
Description: The system will allow Admins or Organization Admins to create and maintain detailed profiles for all staff members.
Data Points: Each staff profile should include:

*   Basic Information: Full name, contact information (email, phone).
*   Profile Photo: Optional.
*   System Role: Assignment to a system role (e.g., "Staff," "Admin" – linking to the roles defined in Section 2) which dictates their access permissions.
*   Job Title/Responsibilities: e.g., "Senior Trainer," "Yoga Instructor," "Front Desk Manager."
*   Qualifications/Certifications: A section to list relevant qualifications, certifications, and expiry dates.
*   Services Provided: Ability to link staff members to specific classes or appointment types they are qualified to deliver. This is crucial for scheduling logic.
*   Availability Templates: Default working hours or availability patterns.

Context: Staff profiles are central to many system functions, including scheduling (determining who can teach which class) and access control. Mindbody allows businesses to manage staff, including assigning roles and controlling permissions.3 A comprehensive staff profile ensures that all relevant information is readily available for administrative and operational purposes. For example, when scheduling a "Advanced Pilates" class, the system should only allow selection of instructors whose profiles indicate they are qualified for that service.

#### 3.3.2. Staff Scheduling & Availability Tracking
Description: The system must provide tools for creating staff work schedules and enabling staff members to manage and communicate their availability for appointments and classes.
Functionality:

Shift Scheduling (Admin): Admins or Organization Admins can create and publish staff shifts or assign staff to specific time blocks for front desk coverage or other duties.
Availability Management (Staff): Staff members can input their general availability (e.g., "available Mondays 9 AM - 5 PM, Wednesdays 12 PM - 8 PM") and specific unavailability (e.g., requesting time off for a vacation). This availability will then be used by the system when scheduling them for classes or appointments.
Time-Off Requests: A formal workflow for staff to request time off, which can then be approved or denied by an Admin. Approved time off automatically blocks their availability.
Automated Staff Substitution: If a scheduled staff member becomes unavailable (e.g., calls in sick), the system should assist in finding a replacement. This could involve:

Suggesting other qualified and available staff members.
Allowing available staff to view and claim open shifts/classes.
Automated notifications to potential substitutes.

Context: Efficient staff scheduling is vital for ensuring adequate coverage for classes and services, and for smooth gym operations. Mindbody allows businesses to manage staff schedules and even automate staff substitutions to avoid class cancellations and maintain revenue flow.3 Staff are also able to manage their availability for appointments.22 Giving staff some control over their availability can improve morale and reduce the administrative burden on managers. The substitution feature, in particular, is a significant value-add as it directly addresses a common operational challenge in service businesses. This implies a calendar interface for staff to set their working hours and for admins to assign them to classes or shifts. The substitution feature would require a workflow where a staff member indicates unavailability for a scheduled class, and the system then helps identify and assign a qualified replacement based on skills and availability.

### 3.5. Organization Management (for Admins)
This section details the settings and tools that Organization Admins will use to configure and customize their specific gym instance within the multi-tenant platform, focusing on MVP requirements.

#### 3.5.1. Facility & Resource Management
Description: Organization Admins must be able to define and manage their physical locations (if they have multiple sites under one organization, though the primary model is one organization = one tenant/gym), rooms within those locations, and key equipment.
Functionality:

Location Setup: Define main facility details (name, address, contact information, business hours).
Room/Space Management: Create and name individual rooms or designated spaces within the facility (e.g., "Main Studio," "Spin Room," "Treatment Room 1").
Resource Capacity: Set the capacity for each room or space (e.g., "Main Studio - 20 mats," "Spin Room - 15 bikes").
Equipment Listing: List available equipment that might be bookable or relevant for class descriptions (e.g., "Pilates Reformers," "TRX Stations").
Resource Linking: Resources (rooms, specific equipment) can be linked to specific classes or appointment types during their setup. This is essential for preventing conflicts (e.g., ensuring a class requiring 10 spin bikes is scheduled in a room that has them, and that the room isn't double-booked).

Context: Effective scheduling and conflict detection are heavily reliant on accurate facility and resource definitions. The Admin role is tasked with overseeing resource allocation as per the user query. If a specific room is booked for a yoga class, the system must know this to prevent another class or appointment from being scheduled in the same room simultaneously. Similarly, understanding resource capacities (like the number of spin bikes) prevents overbooking classes that depend on such equipment.

#### 3.5.2. Service & Class Type Configuration
Description: Organization Admins need the ability to define and configure the various types of services (appointments) and classes offered by their gym.
Functionality:

Service/Class Creation: Create distinct service or class types with unique names (e.g., "60-minute Personal Training Session," "Advanced Vinyasa Yoga," "Beginner Spin Class").
Default Duration: Set a default duration for each service/class type.
Resource Association: Assign default resources (e.g., "Yoga Studio" for yoga classes, "Reformer Bed" for Pilates appointments) to service/class types.
Staff Qualification Linking: Specify which staff members are qualified to provide or instruct each service/class type.
Description & Category: Add descriptions, categories (e.g., "Cardio," "Mind & Body," "Strength"), and potentially difficulty levels.

Context: This configuration forms the backbone of the scheduling system. What members can see and book, and how schedules are constructed by Admins and Staff, is driven by these definitions. Mindbody's system allows for the setup of appointment types and class types, with staff permissions to add or edit these.22 The ability for Staff to "Create and manage class schedules" (as per the user query) implies that these foundational class types must be defined first by an administrator. Flexibility in defining these services is key to accommodating the diverse offerings of different fitness businesses.

## 4. Access Control & Permissions
This section outlines the security model, focusing on role-based access to system functionalities. Access control will be managed by assigning users to predefined roles, each with a specific set of responsibilities and capabilities within the system.

### 4.1. Authentication
Description: The system will provide secure mechanisms for verifying user identity.
Mechanisms:
*   Users will authenticate using a unique email address and a secure password.
*   The system will enforce basic password security practices.

### 4.2. Authorization & User Roles
Description: Authorization will be managed through a role-based access control (RBAC) model. Each user will be assigned a role that dictates their access to various features and data within their organization's scope. The focus for MVP is on high-level role definitions and their primary responsibilities.

The following roles are defined for the MVP:

*   **Super Admin:**
    *   Responsibilities: Overall platform administration, managing system-wide settings, overseeing all organizations. (Primarily for the SaaS provider).
*   **Organization Admin:**
    *   Responsibilities: Manages all aspects of their specific organization, including configuring organization settings, managing staff and member accounts within their organization, and defining organization-specific operational rules.
*   **Admin:**
    *   Responsibilities: Assists the Organization Admin with daily operational tasks, such as managing schedules, staff assignments, member communications, and reviewing operational summaries for their organization.
*   **Staff (e.g., Instructors, Trainers, Front Desk):**
    *   Responsibilities: Manages their own schedules, conducts classes/appointments, views relevant client information for their sessions, and records attendance. Access is generally limited to their assigned duties and client interactions.
*   **Member (Client/Customer):**
    *   Responsibilities: Manages their own profile, books and cancels classes/appointments, views their schedule. Access is limited to their personal data and booking functionalities.
