*   **FR-OM-FM-03: Equipment Management (Bookable Equipment)**
    *   **Description:** List and manage specific pieces of equipment that can be individually booked or are required for certain services (e.g., "Pilates Reformer #1," "Squash Court A").
    *   **Fields:** Equipment Name/ID (e.g., "Reformer 1," "Treadmill 5"), Type (e.g., "Pilates Reformer," "Treadmill"), Location (can be associated with a Room/Space or general facility), Description (optional), Specific Availability.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Organization Admin can add, edit, and delete equipment items.
        *   Equipment can be linked to services that require them.
        *   Availability is crucial for preventing double-booking of the equipment.
    *   **Screen Details (Illustrative - "Manage Resources" > "Equipment" Tab):**
        *   List of existing equipment with columns for Name/ID, Type, Location, Actions (Edit, Delete).
        *   "Add New Equipment" button.
        *   **Add/Edit Equipment Modal/Form:**
            *   Input fields for Name/ID, Type.
            *   Dropdown to select associated Room/Space (if applicable).
            *   Text area for Description.
            *   Optional: Interface to set specific availability hours for this equipment.

*   **FR-OM-FM-04: Resource Linking & Scheduling Attributes**
    *   **Description:** Resources (rooms, equipment) can be linked to specific classes or appointment types during their setup, and their attributes affect scheduling.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   When defining a Service/Class Type (see FR-OM-SC-01), Admin can specify required room type(s) or specific equipment.
        *   The scheduling system uses this information to:
            *   Filter available resources when creating a new session.
            *   Prevent booking a session if a suitable resource is unavailable (conflict detection - FR-SC-CD-01).
            *   Ensure class capacity does not exceed room/resource capacity.
    *   **Screen Details:** This functionality is primarily integrated into the "Service & Class Type Configuration" screen and the "Session Creation" screen, where resources are selected/assigned.

**Flow (Adding a New Room):**
1.  Organization Admin navigates to "Organization Settings" -> "Manage Resources."
2.  Selects the "Rooms/Spaces" tab.
3.  Clicks "Add New Room."
4.  Fills in the Room Name, Capacity, Description, and any specific availability.
5.  Clicks "Save Room."
6.  The new room is now available for assignment to classes/appointments.

## 3. Access Control & Permissions (Functional Aspects)

### 3.1. Authentication
**Description:** The system must provide secure authentication mechanisms for all user roles.
**Functionality:**
*   User login with username (email) and password.
*   Password complexity enforcement.
*   Secure password storage (hashing and salting).
*   Session management.
*   (Future Consideration) Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

### 3.2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Description:** The system will enforce access to functionalities based on pre-defined user roles as detailed in the BRD (Super Admin, Organization Admin, Admin, Staff, Member).
**Functionality:**
*   Each user role will have a specific set of permissions granting or denying access to system features, data, and operations.
*   Permissions will be granular enough to ensure users can only perform actions relevant to their responsibilities.
*   Super Admin: Manages tenants and platform-wide settings.
*   Organization Admin: Manages their specific tenant's settings, users, and operations.
*   Admin: Manages day-to-day operations within a tenant (staff, members, scheduling).
*   Staff: Manages their schedule, tracks attendance, interacts with members for service delivery.
*   Member: Manages their profile, bookings, and payments.
*   Data Isolation: Ensure strict data isolation between tenants. An Organization Admin or any user from one tenant cannot access data from another tenant.
